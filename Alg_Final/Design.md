# Intelligent City Route Planner with Graph Algorithms

## Objective
Develop a system to solve city transportation challenges by applying six graph theory algorithms. The system will integrate AI to recommend the best algorithm based on graph properties.

## Key Components

### 1. Problem Definition
Solve real-world problems using graph algorithms:
1. Find the shortest route between two locations.
2. Check network connectivity.
3. Construct a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to optimize infrastructure costs.
4. Identify critical connections (bridges and articulation points).
5. Optimize project dependency scheduling.
6. Compare NN-MST with Kruskal's algorithm for efficiency in large-scale networks.

### 2. Data Structures
- **Graph Representation**:
  - Use adjacency lists for sparse graphs (e.g., city roads).
  - Use adjacency matrices for dense or heavily interconnected zones.

## Selected Algorithms
Six graph theory algorithms, each solving a specific aspect of the project:

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
   - **Purpose**: Find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.
   - **Application**: Optimizing travel routes.

2. **Astar Search**:
   - **Purpose**: Enhance Dijkstra's by using heuristics for faster results.
   - **Application**: Route planning with geographical data.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - **Purpose**: Traverse or explore the graph for connected components and cycles.
   - **Application**: Identify critical nodes and connectivity.

4. **Articulation Points and Bridges**:
   - **Purpose**: Detect critical connections whose removal would fragment the network.
   - **Application**: Assessing the robustness of city infrastructure.

5. **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm**:
   - **Purpose**: Construct a Minimum Spanning Tree.
   - **Application**: Efficiently planning infrastructure development.

6. **Nearest Neighbor Minimum Spanning Tree (NN-MST)**:
   - **Purpose**: Approximate MST using a greedy heuristic.
   - **Application**: Quick MST computation for large graphs; compare efficiency with Kruskal's.


## Development Steps

### Step 1: Problem Selection
- Focus: Address all six algorithmic use cases.

### Step 2: Design Graph Data Structures
- Represent graphs as adjacency lists or matrices, based on problem type.

### Step 3: Implement Algorithms
- Modularize all six algorithms to ensure flexibility and reusability.

### Step 4: Input Handling
- Accept graph input through:
  - **Files**: CSVs containing nodes, edges, and weights.
  - **Interactive Input**: Users can define or edit graphs.

### Step 5: Output Presentation
- Display results clearly:
  - Shortest paths as routes with distances or costs.
  - Connectivity visualized through subgraph clusters.
  - MSTs visualized and compared (Kruskal's vs NN-MST).

### Step 6: AI/ML Integration
- Use graph properties (e.g., density, weight distribution) to recommend algorithms.

## Advanced Features
- Compare the time complexity and performance of Kruskal's vs NN-MST on large graphs.
- Identify vulnerabilities in the network (e.g., single points of failure).
- Visualize graphs and algorithm outputs using libraries like NetworkX and Matplotlib.
